    "#### Servers and data centers\n",
    "<p>What is a server? A server serves as a specialized computer designed to furnish data or services to other computer across a network. Its fundamental role is to respond to requests initiated by client computers, facilitating seamless communication and data exchange. Distinguished by its hardware specifications, servers typically feature expanded memory capacity and support for multiple CPUs, enabling them to handle substantial workloads efficiently. Moreover, they incorporate redundancy mechanism such as duplicate power supplies and network interfaces to ensure continuous operation. Often compact in design, servers are optimized for rack-mounted deployment in data centers. Examples of servers types span various functions, including web servers for hosting websites, database servers for managing data storage and retrieval, and mail servers for facilitating email communication. These exemplify the divers roles serves fulfill in enabling and enhancing networked computing environments.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/CloudFoundations/Client&Server-Eg.png\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a web application is an example use case for servers. A web application is typically deployed to a web server, which is responsible for directing client requests to it. A web application usually stores its application data on a database server. The database server runs a special type of software that’s called a database management system (DBMS). The DBMS controls the organization, security, and access of the data.Examples of a DBMS are MySQL, an open-source relational database management system; and Oracle, a relational DBMS that Oracle Corporation owns and offers. The following list shows the flow of information in the example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user opens a browser on a client machine and enters the address of the web \n",
    "application’s homepage. This address is called its home Uniform Resource Locator \n",
    "(URL) (for example, https://anycompanywebapp.com).\n",
    "2. The web server receives the client request and directs it to the appropriate web \n",
    "application.\n",
    "3. The web application sends a request to the database server to access its \n",
    "application data.\n",
    "4. The database server returns the requested data to the web application.\n",
    "5. The web application builds the response webpage and passes it to the web server, \n",
    "which returns the page to the client browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where does server reside**\n",
    "\n",
    "Servers reside in a data center. A data center is a physical location that is used to host computer systems and associated components such as networks, storage devices, and power supplies. Data centers are designed to be secure and to provide an ideal climate for the contained equipment to operate. They must protect the equipment from many types of failures and accidents, including power losses and fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who owns data center**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional on-premise model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, organizations owned their data centers. The equipment was on premises at a location that the company owned. If you follow this model, you are the one who buys, installs, configures, and manages all the hardware and software in your own facility. You are responsible for installation, maintenance, and numerous other costs. You also must hire the staff who are responsible for the maintenance of the hardware, software, and the facility itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud model**\n",
    "\n",
    "The cloud model provides another option: a cloud services provider buys the hardware and infrastructure software in their own facility. They manage and maintain it with their own personnel. You bring your application or workload to run on their servers and pay for the services that they offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Virtual Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is virtual machine?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/CloudFoundations/eg-virtualization.png\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual machine (VM) is a computer that is emulated through software. It is virtual because it is not a physical computer. Instead, specialized software, which is called virtualization software, runs inside a physical computer to provide the computing capabilities of a VM. In other words, a VM is a software-based computer that runs inside a physical computer.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The physical computer where a VM runs is called a host. The VM provides computing capabilities by accessing the physical resources of the host through a software layer, which is called a hypervisor. The hypervisor shares the host’s physical resources—such as its CPU, memory, disk drives, and networking capabilities—among the VMs that run on the host. A VM can run its own operating system, and multiple VMs can run on a single host. With virtualization, you can separate your operating system and applications from the computer’s hardware. Use cases for VMs include virtual desktops, multiple operating support, and cloud computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of VMs**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Cost Savings*: Running multiple VMs on a single physizal machine reduces the need to buy a new computer.\n",
    "2. *Efficiency*: Running multiple VMs on a single physical computer increases its utilization.\n",
    "3. *Reusability and portability*: You can copy a VM image on the same physical host or move it to a different host to duplicate the VM's computing environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VMs in the cloud**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vms are the fundamental unit of computing in the cloud. that provide the folloning;\n",
    "1. Self-service.\n",
    "2. Ability to pay for only what you use.\n",
    "3. Scalability.\n",

    "- **Plan**: What is the problem and what resources do you need to solve it?\n",
    "The goals of the project are identified along with the resources that are required to implement them. The output of this phase is a *project plan*.\n",
    "- **Analyze**: What do you want from a solution?\n",
    "Product requirement are clearly defined and documented in a *software requirement specification (SRS)*.\n",
    "- **Design**: How will you build what you want?\n",
    "  Using SRS, different types of architecture are evaluated for the best use in the project. More than one design approach is created and proposed in a *designed specification document*. The *design specification document* contains detailed functional descriptions and other information, such as user interface descriptinos. The design options are reviewed for risk, budget and time constraints. The best design is then selected.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Develop**: Build what you designed. The actual writing of the computer code happens in this phase, and the product is built.\n",
    "- **Test**: Did you get what you want? The purpose of the test phase is to validate that the application components function as intended. This phase is also used to uncover and correct defects before the application is released to users. Common type of testing include the following; a) Unit Test, b) Integration Test, c) Security Test, d) Performance Test\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unit testing tests individual application components at the program level. The programmer usually does this test.\n",
    "2. Integration testing tests the combination of multiple application components to verify that they work together correctly.\n",
    "3. Security testing tests to see whether the application is vulnerable from internal or external threats.\n",
    "4. Performance testing tests to see whether the application meets its expected performance requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implement**: Start to use what you built. Implementation is often called deployment. The customer approves and signs off the completion of the application. The application is released and used in production.\n",
    "- **Maintain**: Improve what you built. As soon as the application is in production, it must be monitored and maintained. The following are the four general types of application maintenance:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Corrective maintenance is used to fix a problem that occurs and for which a solution is identified.\n",
    "2. Adaptive maintenance is required when something in the application’s runtime environment is going to change. For example, an upgrade is planned for the database software that the application uses.\n",
    "3. Perfective maintenance occurs when new or revised functionality is identified for the application. For example, the user requests a change in the user interface.\n",
    "4. Preventive maintenance consists of changes that are made to avoid potential issues in the future. For example, code is redesigned or restructured for easier maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify how maintainance works as follows:\n",
    "1. Defect or error identified → Corrective maintenance.\n",
    "2. Changes in application environment → Adaptive maintenance.\n",
    "3. Changes in application requirements → Perfective maintenance.\n",
    "4. Prevent the occurrence of errors → Preventive maintenance.\n",

    "- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources.\n",
    "- These resources are delivered through a cloud services platform through the internet with payas-you-go pricing. In its most basic definition, the cloud is a computer that is located somewhere else, accessed through the internet, and used in some way. Web services is another name for what people call the cloud.\n",

    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/CloudFoundations/cloudServiceModel.png\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cloud services fall into one of three primary categories, which are based mainly on how much control and responsibility you have over the service’s configuration. With infrastructure as a service (IaaS), you manage the server, which can be physical or virtual, and the operating system (Microsoft Windows or Linux). In general, the data center provider has no access to your server.\n",
    "- With platform as a service (PaaS), someone else manages the underlying hardware and operating systems. With this option, you can run applications without managing underlying infrastructure (for example, patching, updates, maintenance, hardware, and operating systems). PaaS also provides a framework for developers that they can build on to create customized applications.\n",
    "- With software as a service (SaaS), you manage your files while the service provider manages all data centers, servers, networks, storage, maintenance, and patching. You handle only the software and how you want to use it. You are provided with a complete product that the service provider runs and manages. Facebook and Dropbox are examples of SaaS. You manage your Facebook contacts and Dropbox files, and the service providers manage the systems.\n",

    "<b>Cloud (or all-in cloud)</b> is a cloud-based application that is fully deployed in the cloud. All parts of the application run in the cloud. Applications in the cloud were either created in the cloud or migrated from an existing infrastructure. Cloud-based applications can be built on low-level infrastructure pieces (for example, networking, compute, or storage). They can also use higher-level services that provide abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not in the cloud. The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure. On-premises infrastructure is located in the physical confines of an enterprise, often in the company's data center. A hybrid deployment model is used to extend an organization's infrastructure into the cloud while it connects cloud resources to an internal system. For more information about how AWS can help you  with a hybrid deployment, see [Hybrid Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/hybrid/) with AWS.\n",
    "\n",
